# Nucleoside_finder

This repo contains an Jupyter Notebook used to search Orbitrap LC-MS/,MS data for nucleosides. This notebook was written by Peter Thuy-Buon, with additions by Adair Borges. This repo also contains mass lists for nucleosides, charged adducts, and neutral adducts. We have included the outputs from the script: dRibose_neutral_loss_combined_raw_results.csv contains raw results from this analysis, and dRibose_neutral_loss_scatter.jpg is a scatterplot of precursor ion m/z to fragment m/z. dRibose_neutral_loss_summary_results.csv is the most useful file with the nicely summarized results. Orbitrap data are available through Zenodo.
