# nucleoside-finder

This repo contains an Jupyter Notebook used to search Orbitrap LC-MS/MS data for nucleosides. This notebook was written by [Peter Thuy-Boun](https://github.com/petertb), with additions by [Adair Borges](https://github.com/borgesadair1). This repo also contains mass lists for nucleosides, charged adducts, and neutral adducts. We have included the outputs from the script: `dRibose_neutral_loss_combined_raw_results.csv` contains raw results from this analysis, and `dRibose_neutral_loss_scatter.jpg` is a scatterplot of precursor ion m/z to fragment m/z. `dRibose_neutral_loss_summary_results.csv` is the most useful file with the nicely summarized results. Orbitrap data are available through Zenodo: [10.5281/zenodo.7319990](https://zenodo.org/record/7319990#.Y4UDYuxuewk)
